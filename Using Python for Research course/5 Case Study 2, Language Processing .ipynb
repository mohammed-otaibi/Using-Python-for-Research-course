       "'Romeo and JulietFolger Shakespeare LibraryContentsFrom the Director of the Folger Shakespeare LibraryIt is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to make them their own.Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason, new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as Folger Digital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theater.I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.Michael WitmoreDirector, Folger Shakespeare LibraryTextual IntroductionBy Barbara Mowat and Paul WerstineUntil now, with the release of the Folger Digital Texts, readers in search of a free online text of Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate text.Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created, for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest, 1.2 “Abhorred slave,Which any print of goodness wilt not take,Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her father, Prospero.The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™, which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello “square bracketIf she in chains of magic were not bound,square bracket”), half-square brackets (for example, from Henry V “With half-square bracketbloodhalf-square bracket and sword and fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet “O farewell, honest angle bracketsoldier.angle bracket Who hath relievedyou”). At any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information.Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and enjoyment of Shakespeare.SynopsisThe prologue of Romeo and Juliet calls the title characters “star-crossed lovers”—and the stars do seem to conspire against these young lovers.Romeo is a Montague, and Juliet a Capulet. Their families are enmeshed in a feud, but the moment they meet—when Romeo and his friends attend a party at Juliet’s house in disguise—the two fall in love and quickly decide that they want to be married.A friar secretly marries them, hoping to end the feud. Romeo and his companions almost immediately encounter Juliet’s cousin Tybalt, who challenges Romeo. When Romeo refuses to fight, Romeo’s friend Mercutio accepts the challenge and is killed. Romeo then kills Tybalt and is banished. He spends that night with Juliet and then leaves for Mantua.Juliet’s father forces her into a marriage with Count Paris. To avoid this marriage, Juliet takes a potion, given her by the friar, that makes her appear dead. The friar will send Romeo word to be at her family tomb when she awakes. The plan goes awry, and Romeo learns instead that she is dead. In the tomb, Romeo kills himself. Juliet wakes, sees his body, and commits suicide. Their deaths appear finally to end the feud.Characters in the PlayROMEOMONTAGUE, his fatherLADY MONTAGUE, his motherBENVOLIO, their kinsmanABRAM, a Montague servingmanBALTHASAR, Romeo’s servingmanJULIETCAPULET, her fatherLADY CAPULET, her motherNURSE to JulietTYBALT, kinsman to the CapuletsPETRUCHIO, Tybalt’s companionCapulet’s CousinSAMPSONGREGORYPETERbracketservingmenOther ServingmenESCALUS, Prince of VeronaPARIS, the Prince’s kinsman and Juliet’s suitorMERCUTIO, the Prince’s kinsman and Romeo’s friendParis’ PageFRIAR LAWRENCEFRIAR JOHNAPOTHECARYThree or four CitizensThree MusiciansThree WatchmenCHORUSAttendants, Maskers, Torchbearers, a Boy with a drum, Gentlemen, Gentlewomen, Tybalt’s Page, Servingmen.THE PROLOGUEeditorial emendationEntereditorial emendation Chorus.

In the instant cameThe fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,He swung about his head and cut the winds,Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.While we were interchanging thrusts and blowsCame more and more and fought on part and part,Till the Prince came, who parted either part.LADY MONTAGUE O, where is Romeo Saw you him todayRight glad I am he was not at this fray.BENVOLIO Madam, an hour before the worshiped sunPeered forth the golden window of the east,A troubled mind editorial emendationdroveeditorial emendation me to walk abroad,Where underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from this city side,So early walking did I see your son.Towards him I made, but he was ’ware of meAnd stole into the covert of the wood.I, measuring his affections by my own(Which then most sought where most might not befound,Being one too many by my weary self),Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the farthest east begin to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,Away from light steals home my heavy sonAnd private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,And makes himself an artificial night.Black and portentous must this humor prove,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.BENVOLIO My noble uncle, do you know the causeMONTAGUE I neither know it nor can learn of him.BENVOLIO Have you importuned him by any meansMONTAGUE Both by myself and many other friends.But he, editorial emendationhiseditorial emendation own affections’ counselor,Is to himself—I will not say how true,But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious wormEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the airOr dedicate his beauty to the same.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,We would as willingly give cure as know.Enter Romeo.BENVOLIO See where he comes. So please you, step aside.I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.MONTAGUE I would thou wert so happy by thy stayTo hear true shrift.—Come, madam, let’s away.editorial emendationMontague and Lady Montagueeditorial emendation exit.BENVOLIO Good morrow, cousin.ROMEO Is the day so youngBENVOLIO But new struck nine.ROMEO Ay me, sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fastBENVOLIO It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hoursROMEO Not having that which, having, makes them short.BENVOLIO In loveROMEO Out—BENVOLIO Of loveROMEO Out of her favor where I am in love.BENVOLIO Alas that love, so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!ROMEO Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,Should without eyes see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine—O me! What fray was hereYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,O anything of nothing first editorial emendationcreate!editorial emendationO heavy lightness, serious vanity,Misshapen chaos of editorial emendationwell-seemingeditorial emendation forms,Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!This love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laughBENVOLIO No, coz, I rather weep.ROMEO Good heart, at whatBENVOLIO At thy good heart’s oppression.ROMEO Why, such is love’s transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressedWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.What is it else A madness most discreet,A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz.BENVOLIO Soft, I will go along.An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.ROMEO Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.This is not Romeo. He’s some other where.BENVOLIO Tell me in sadness, who is that you loveROMEO What, shall I groan and tell theeBENVOLIO Groan Why, no. But sadly tell me who.ROMEO A sick man in sadness makes his will—A word ill urged to one that is so ill.In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.BENVOLIO I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.ROMEO A right good markman! And she’s fair I love.BENVOLIO A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.ROMEO Well in that hit you miss. She’ll not be hitWith Cupid’s arrow. She hath Dian’s wit,And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.She will not stay the siege of loving terms,Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.O, she is rich in beauty, only poorThat, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.BENVOLIO Then she hath sworn that she will still live chasteROMEO She hath, and in that sparing editorial emendationmakeseditorial emendation huge waste;For beauty, starved with her severity,Cuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair.She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.BENVOLIO Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think!BENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes.Examine other beauties.ROMEO ’Tis the wayTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.Show me a mistress that is passing fair;What doth her beauty serve but as a noteWhere I may read who passed that passing fairFarewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.BENVOLIO I’ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.They exit.editorial emendationScene 2editorial emendationEnter Capulet, County Paris, and editorial emendationa Servingman.editorial emendationCAPULET But Montague is bound as well as I,In penalty alike, and ’tis not hard, I think,For men so old as we to keep the peace.PARIS Of honorable reckoning are you both,And pity ’tis you lived at odds so long.But now, my lord, what say you to my suitCAPULET But saying o’er what I have said before.My child is yet a stranger in the world.She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.Let two more summers wither in their prideEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.PARIS Younger than she are happy mothers made.CAPULET And too soon marred are those so early made.Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;She’s the hopeful lady of my earth.But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;My will to her consent is but a part.And, she agreed, within her scope of choiceLies my consent and fair according voice.This night I hold an old accustomed feast,Whereto I have invited many a guestSuch as I love; and you among the store,One more, most welcome, makes my number more.At my poor house look to behold this nightEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.Such comfort as do lusty young men feelWhen well-appareled April on the heelOf limping winter treads, even such delightAmong fresh fennel buds shall you this nightInherit at my house.

Well, Susan is with God;She was too good for me. But, as I said,On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)Of all the days of the year, upon that day.For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.My lord and you were then at Mantua.Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with editorial emendationtheeditorial emendation dug.“Shake,” quoth the dovehouse. ’Twas no need, Itrow,To bid me trudge.And since that time it is eleven years.For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th’rood,She could have run and waddled all about,For even the day before, she broke her brow,And then my husband (God be with his soul,He was a merry man) took up the child.“Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy faceThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,Wilt thou not, Jule” And, by my holidam,The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”To see now how a jest shall come about!I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,I never should forget it. “Wilt thou not, Jule”quoth he.And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”LADY CAPULET Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.NURSE Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laughTo think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”And yet, I warrant, it had upon its browA bump as big as a young cock’rel’s stone,A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.“Yea,” quoth my husband. “Fall’st upon thy faceThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,Wilt thou not, Jule” It stinted and said “Ay.”JULIET And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.NURSE Peace.

Look thou but sweet,And I am proof against their enmity.JULIET I would not for the world they saw thee here.ROMEO I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,And, but thou love me, let them find me here.My life were better ended by their hateThan death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.JULIET By whose direction found’st thou out this placeROMEO By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as farAs that vast shore editorial emendationwashededitorial emendation with the farthest sea,I should adventure for such merchandise.JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke. But farewell compliment.Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say “Ay,”And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,And therefore thou mayst think my editorial emendationhavioreditorial emendation light.But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more trueThan those that have editorial emendationmoreeditorial emendation coying to be strange.I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard’st ere I was wareMy true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,And not impute this yielding to light love,Which the dark night hath so discoverèd.ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—JULIET O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her editorial emendationcirclededitorial emendation orb,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.ROMEO What shall I swear byJULIET Do not swear at all.Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I’ll believe thee.ROMEO If my heart’s dear love—JULIET Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,I have no joy of this contract tonight.It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,Too like the lightning, which doth cease to beEre one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.Good night, good night. As sweet repose and restCome to thy heart as that within my breast.ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfiedJULIET What satisfaction canst thou have tonightROMEO Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.JULIET I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,And yet I would it were to give again.ROMEO Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose, loveJULIET But to be frank and give it thee again.And yet I wish but for the thing I have.My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep.

When and where and howWe met, we wooed, and made exchange of vowI’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,That thou consent to marry us today.FRIAR LAWRENCE Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken Young men’s love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.Jesu Maria, what a deal of brineHath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!How much salt water thrown away in wasteTo season love, that of it doth not taste!The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sitOf an old tear that is not washed off yet.If e’er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.And art thou changed Pronounce this sentencethenWomen may fall when there’s no strength in men.ROMEO Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.FRIAR LAWRENCE For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.ROMEO And bad’st me bury love.FRIAR LAWRENCE Not in a graveTo lay one in, another out to have.ROMEO I pray thee, chide me not.

Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning matchPlayed for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day innight,For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browednight,Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.O, I have bought the mansion of a loveBut not possessed it, and, though I am sold,Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them.Enter Nurse with cords.O, here comes my nurse,And she brings news, and every tongue that speaksBut Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.—Now, nurse, what news What hast thou there ThecordsThat Romeo bid thee fetchNURSE Ay, ay, the cords.editorial emendationDropping the rope ladder.editorial emendationJULIET Ay me, what news Why dost thou wring thy handsNURSE Ah weraday, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!We are undone, lady, we are undone.Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead.JULIET Can heaven be so enviousNURSE Romeo can,Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo,Whoever would have thought it Romeo!JULIET What devil art thou that dost torment me thusThis torture should be roared in dismal hell.Hath Romeo slain himself Say thou but “Ay,”And that bare vowel “I” shall poison moreThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.I am not I if there be such an “I,”Or those eyes editorial emendationshuteditorial emendation that makes thee answer “Ay.”If he be slain, say “Ay,” or if not, “No.”Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.NURSE I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast—A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,All in gore blood. I swoonèd at the sight.JULIET O break, my heart, poor bankrout, break at once!To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.NURSE O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,That ever I should live to see thee dead!JULIET What storm is this that blows so contraryIs Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt deadMy dearest cousin, and my dearer lordThen, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,For who is living if those two are goneNURSE Tybalt is gone and Romeo banishèd.Romeo that killed him—he is banishèd.JULIET O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s bloodeditorial emendationNURSEeditorial emendation It did, it did, alas the day, it did.editorial emendationJULIETeditorial emendation O serpent heart hid with a flow’ring face!Did ever dragon keep so fair a caveBeautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!Despisèd substance of divinest show!Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,A editorial emendationdamnèdeditorial emendation saint, an honorable villain.O nature, what hadst thou to do in hellWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiendIn mortal paradise of such sweet fleshWas ever book containing such vile matterSo fairly bound O, that deceit should dwellIn such a gorgeous palace!NURSE There’s no trust,No faith, no honesty in men.

He was not born to shame.Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,For ’tis a throne where honor may be crownedSole monarch of the universal Earth.O, what a beast was I to chide at him!NURSE Will you speak well of him that killed your cousinJULIET Shall I speak ill of him that is my husbandAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thynameWhen I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled itBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousinThat villain cousin would have killed my husband.Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;Your tributary drops belong to woe,Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain myhusband.All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I thenSome word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,That murdered me. I would forget it fain,But, O, it presses to my memoryLike damnèd guilty deeds to sinners’ minds“Tybalt is dead and Romeo banishèd.”That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd,”Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s deathWas woe enough if it had ended there;Or, if sour woe delights in fellowshipAnd needly will be ranked with other griefs,Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,”“Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both,Which modern lamentation might have movedBut with a rearward following Tybalt’s death,“Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that wordIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,All slain, all dead. “Romeo is banishèd.”There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,In that word’s death. No words can that woe sound.Where is my father and my mother, nurseNURSE Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.Will you go to them I will bring you thither.JULIET Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall bespent,When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.—Take up those cords.editorial emendationThe Nurse picks up the rope ladder.editorial emendationPoor ropes, you are beguiled,Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.He made you for a highway to my bed,But I, a maid, die maiden-widowèd.Come, cords—come, nurse.

Do not say “banishment.”FRIAR LAWRENCE Here from Verona art thou banishèd.Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.ROMEO There is no world without Verona wallsBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.Hence “banishèd” is “banished from the world,”And world’s exile is death. Then “banishèd”Is death mistermed. Calling death “banishèd,”Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.FRIAR LAWRENCE O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the lawAnd turned that black word “death” to“banishment.”This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.ROMEO ’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is hereWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dogAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,Live here in heaven and may look on her,But Romeo may not. More validity,More honorable state, more courtship livesIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seizeOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s handAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,Who even in pure and vestal modestyStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;But Romeo may not; he is banishèd.Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.They are free men, but I am banishèd.And sayest thou yet that exile is not deathHadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-groundknife,No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,But “banishèd” to kill me “Banishèd”O friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.Howling attends it.

What manners is in this,To press before thy father to a gravePRINCE Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,Till we can clear these ambiguitiesAnd know their spring, their head, their truedescent,And then will I be general of your woesAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,And let mischance be slave to patience.—Bring forth the parties of suspicion.FRIAR LAWRENCE I am the greatest, able to do least,Yet most suspected, as the time and placeDoth make against me, of this direful murder.And here I stand, both to impeach and purgeMyself condemnèd and myself excused.PRINCE Then say at once what thou dost know in this.FRIAR LAWRENCE I will be brief, for my short date of breathIs not so long as is a tedious tale.Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,And she, there dead, editorial emendationthateditorial emendation Romeo’s faithful wife.I married them, and their stol’n marriage dayWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely deathBanished the new-made bridegroom from this city,For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.You, to remove that siege of grief from her,Betrothed and would have married her perforceTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,And with wild looks bid me devise some meanTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)A sleeping potion, which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death. Meantime I writ to RomeoThat he should hither come as this dire nightTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,Being the time the potion’s force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stayed by accident, and yesternightReturned my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixèd hour of her wakingCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,Meaning to keep her closely at my cellTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awakening, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes, and I entreated her come forthAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,And she, too desperate, would not go with meBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know, and to the marriageHer nurse is privy. And if aught in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrificed some hour before his timeUnto the rigor of severest law.PRINCE We still have known thee for a holy man.—Where’s Romeo’s man What can he say to thisBALTHASAR I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,And then in post he came from MantuaTo this same place, to this same monument.This letter he early bid me give his fatherAnd threatened me with death, going in the vault,If I departed not and left him there.PRINCE Give me the letter. I will look on it.—editorial emendationHe takes Romeo’s letter.editorial emendationWhere is the County’s page, that raised thewatch—Sirrah, what made your master in this placePAGE He came with flowers to strew his lady’s graveAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,And by and by my master drew on him,And then I ran away to call the watch.PRINCE This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,Their course of love, the tidings of her death;And here he writes that he did buy a poisonOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithalCame to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.Where be these enemies—Capulet, Montague,See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,And I, for winking at your discords too,Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.CAPULET O brother Montague, give me thy hand.This is my daughter’s jointure, for no moreCan I demand.MONTAGUE But I can give thee more,For I will ray her statue in pure gold,That whiles Verona by that name is known,There shall no figure at such rate be setAs that of true and faithful Juliet.CAPULET As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,Poor sacrifices of our enmity.PRINCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings.The sun for sorrow will not show his head.Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.Some shall be pardoned, and some punishèd.For never was a story of more woeThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.editorial emendationAll exit.editorial emendation'"
